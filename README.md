# Note Taker App

**Description:**
This website is meant for you to take notes and save them as necessary. When typing a note with a title and body into the text field, a save icon will pop up in the top right corner. Once you're satisfied with your note, click the save icon and the note will be saved on the right hand sidebar. If you wish to recall a note, click on the title saved in the sidebar and the note will load into the text field. To cancel this and add a new note, simply click the plus icon in the top right to add a new note!
